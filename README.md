# Welcome to Quercus!
## About:
### Quercus is a learning management system for the linneaus classification system. It's goal is to assist anyone in learning to identify organisms on sight. Quercus is a Next.JS application using typescript, SWR, and the GBIF Database. It evolved from a desire to be able to identify the plants and insects in my local area.

## Why "Quercus"?
### Quercus is the latin term for Oak. My realization that I didn't know what an Oak leaf looked like was what inspired this application.
