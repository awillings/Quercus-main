# Welcome to Quercus!
## About:
### Quercus is a learning management system for the linneaus classification system. It's goal is to assist anyone in learning to identify organisms on sight. Quercus is a Next.JS application using typescript, SWR, and the GBIF Database. 

## Why "Quercus"?
### Quercus is the latin term for Oak, and as Quercus L. was the plant that inspired this project, I found the name appropriate.
